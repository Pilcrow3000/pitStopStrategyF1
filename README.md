## Introduction

Pit stops are critical components in motorsport racing, often determining the outcome of a race. This project aims to analyze historical race data to develop predictive models that can assist in formulating effective pit stop strategies.

## Objectives

- Analyze the Fast-F1 dataset to extract relevant features influencing pit stop decisions.
- Develop predictive models to forecast optimal pit stop timing and strategy.
- Evaluate the performance of these models using appropriate metrics.

## Dataset

The analysis is based on the Fast-F1 dataset, which provides comprehensive data on various aspects of Formula 1 races, including lap times, tire choices, and pit stop information.

## Methodology

1. **Data Exploration:** Understanding the structure and contents of the dataset.
2. **Data Preprocessing:** Cleaning the data and handling missing values.
3. **Feature Engineering:** Creating new features that could improve model performance.
4. **Model Development:** Implementing machine learning models to predict pit stop strategies.
5. **Model Evaluation:** Assessing model performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall.

## Results

The predictive models demonstrated the ability to forecast pit stop strategies with a certain degree of accuracy. Detailed results and analysis are provided in the accompanying report/notebook.

## Conclusion

This project showcases the potential of data-driven approaches in enhancing decision-making processes in motorsport racing. Further improvements could be achieved by incorporating additional data sources and refining the models.
